# AHB-to-APB-Bridge

### AMBA specification
The Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) specification defines an on-chip communications standard for designing high-performance embedded 
microcontrollers. 
Three distinct buses are defined within the AMBA specification:

• the Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB)

• the Advanced System Bus (ASB)

• the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)


#### 1) Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB)
The AMBA AHB is for high-performance, high clock frequency system modules. The AHB acts as the high-performance system backbone bus. AHB supports the 
efficient connection of processors, on-chip memories and off-chip external memory interfaces with low-power peripheral macrocell functions. AHB is also specified to ensure ease of use in an efficient design flow using synthesis and automated test 
techniques.

#### 2) Advanced System Bus (ASB)
The AMBA ASB is for high-performance system modules.
AMBA ASB is an alternative system bus suitable for use where the high-performance 
features of AHB are not required. ASB also supports the efficient connection of 
processors, on-chip memories and off-chip external memory interfaces with low-power 
peripheral macrocell functions. 

#### 3) Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)
The AMBA APB is for low-power peripherals.AMBA APB is optimized for minimal power consumption and reduced interface 
complexity to support peripheral functions. APB can be used in conjunction with either version of the system bus

### AHB-to-APB-Bridge
The AHB to APB bridge is an AHB slave, providing an interface between the high speed AHB and low power APB. Read and Write transfer of AHB are converted to equivalent transfer on the APB. As APB is not pipelined, then wait states are added during the transfers to and from the APB when AHB is required to wait for the APB.

The main section of this module are:
1) AHB slave bus interface
2) APB transfer state machine    
3) APB output signal generation

### Function and operation of module
The APB bridge resquest transaction requests from the currently granted AHB master. The  AHB transaction are then converted into APB transactions. The state machine controls: 
1) The AHB  transaction with HREADYout signal
2) generation  of all APB output  signals

The indivdual PSELx signals are decoded from HADDR, using the state machine to enable the outputs while the APB transactions is being performed.

If an undefined system is reached, operation of the system will work as normal, but no peripherals are selected.

## Implementation
### Objective
To design and simulate a synthesizable AHB to APB bridge interface using Verilog and run single read and single write tests using AHB Master and APB Slave testbenches. The bridge unit converts system bus transfers into APB transfers and performs the following functions:

1) Latches the address and holds it valid throughout the transfer.
2) Decodes the address and generates a peripheral select, PSELx. Only one select signal can be active during a transfer.
3) Drives the data onto the APB for a write transfer.
4) Drives the APB data onto the system bus for a read transfer.
5) Generates a timing strobe, PENABLE, for the transfer
6) Can implement single read and write operations successfully.
7) The diagram below shows the interface:

### APB Bridge

#### Basic Implementation Tools
*HDL Used : Verilog
*Simulator Tool Used: ModelSIM
*Synthesis Tool Used: Quartus Prime
*Family: Cyclone V
*Device: 5CSXFC6D6F31I7ES

### Design Modules
#### AHB Slave Interface
An AHB bus slave responds to transfers initiated by bus masters within the system. The slave uses a HSELx select signal from the decoder to determine when it should respond to a bus transfer. All other signals required for the transfer, such as the address and control information, will be generated by the bus master.

#### APB Controller
The AHB to APB bridge comprises a state machine, which is used to control the generation of the APB and AHB output signals, and the address decoding logic which is used to generate the APB peripheral select lines.

####  Notes
The design files are attached in the repository along with the AHB Master and APB Slave which generates the appropriate signals. Only the Bridge is synthesizable and other modules are used as testbenches only to generate the necessary read/write operations. Below are the screenshots from the synthesis and the simulator tool
